# DESCRIPTION

🚀 **Load Testing a Web Application using Locust**

This project demonstrates how to perform advanced load testing on a web application using Locust — a modern, scalable, and Python-based load testing tool.

📌 **What is Load Testing?**

Load Testing is a type of performance testing used to evaluate how a system behaves under a specific expected load. It helps identify bottlenecks, stability issues, and ensures the system can handle real-world traffic.

✅ **Project Highlights**

📄 Written in Python

🔁 Simulates multiple users accessing various endpoints

🧪 Tests for response time, throughput, and failure rates

🕸️ Web-based UI to control and monitor load tests in real-time

📊 Ideal for testing REST APIs, websites, or microservices

🧰 **Tools Used**

Python 3.8+

Locust 2.x

PyCharm (optional IDE)

📂 **File Structure**

locustfile.py         # Main Locust script with test scenarios

applicationtest.py    # Optional endpoint tests

Test.py               # Additional script (if needed)

🚦 **How to Run Locust**

Install Locust (if not already):

pip install locust

**Navigate to project directory and run:**

locust --host http://localhost:8080

**Open your browser and go to:**

http://localhost:8089

Enter the number of users and spawn rate, then start the test.

📈 # Output
